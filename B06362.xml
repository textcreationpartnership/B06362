            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>The Inſcription of the Epiſtle.</head>
               <p>
                  <q>[To all the Publick Teachers in this Nation, who are by themſelves and the world, called Miniſters of the Goſpell.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore I go further, I ſhall obſerve in anſwer to this Inſcription, theſe four things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this Author thinks it not enough (I know not whether he ſcorne or no) to lay hands on <hi>Mordecai</hi> alone, and to oppoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againſt my poor ſelf, whom he might with more eaſe, and leſſe ſinne, have troden under foot; but his deſigne is to diſgrace the publick Teachers throughout the whol Nation, unto whom therefore he gives the odious name of Chief-Prieſts, (which they never owned, and by which never any Saint, that we read, or know of, called them) the better thereby to faſten upon them his monſtrous and fictitious accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he that prefixed this Title cannot but know, that himſelf hath heard, not only the world, but many Saints al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, call the Teachers of this Land by the name of Miniſters, unleſſe he be come to that paſſe to think that none are Saints but Quakers, and that he was none himſelf, till he was one of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the people of this Nation, and he among the reſt, whether they and he hear, or whether they will forbear, ſhall know one day that there have been Prophets and Miniſters among them <hi>Ezeck</hi> 2.5.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A fourth thing which I obſerve, and offer to the Reader to take notice of is this, that he that caſts all that dirt, that is in this foule Epiſtle upon publick Teachers, was lately a publick Teacher himſelf, though not by the world nor the Saints, called a Miniſter, as having not (for that his carriage
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:183687:2"/>makes to appear) ſo much love to the Miniſtry, as to engage in it, nor ſo much fear of it as to forbear without a due Call, or a true heart to it, to be tampering about it he gave a Say to that calling, and it might have been thought that he would have been a ſtar to have lead others to Jeſus Chriſt, but he he is proved a Comet, and is now not only fallen to the earth, but (which I am ſorry to ſpeak, but this Book will ſpeak it) falls foul upon heaven, which I cannot but preſent as a very conſiderable warning to all others that take the boldneſſe to be publick Teachers without any minde and meaning to be Miniſters of Chriſt in the way of Chriſt, leaſt God not only give them over to teach erroneous things (which they often do) but leave them at laſt to fall off from preaching them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without a calling, to be bitter enemies to thoſe that preach with a calling; as this miſerable man declares himſelf to be; who notwithſtanding hath nothing to defend himſelf from the dint of his own ſword-like words, but only this, that he is no Miniſter, and making us none neithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </note>I ſhall now apply my ſelf to my Opponent, with whom my Brethren have dealt providently in Querying him out of his ſtarting hols, that ſo there may be a fair fight in the open field. Were his meaning fair and honeſt, and he intended no more when he ſaith, he that followeth that light; but that he that follows Chriſt the great light of the world, as he directeth by his Word &amp; Spirit ſhould have the light of life; or that Chriſt Jeſus the light were ſufficient to teach and guide to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I ſay, if he meant thus, we ſhould not gainſay him, and The Charge in ſuch a ſenſe is his own, not ours: But if his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning be that Chriſt puts a ſufficient light within every man that comes into the world to guide him unto the Father and unto life. I deny that to be true, and charge him and his company with falſhood in affirming it, for that natural light (which is the alone light that Chriſt the word communicates to all men univerſally) ſhines in ſo much darknes ſince the fall that the darknes comprehends it not ſo, as to make out that from it which is ſufficient for ſalvation<note n="t" place="margin">Joh. 1.5.</note>. Its true, that Chriſt or the light <hi>[lightning]</hi> is ſufficient to guide to the Father every one that comes into the world, but not every light of Chriſt <hi>[lighted]</hi> Let him ſhew any Scripture that ſaith, that Chriſt ſo enlightens every man as that that light is ſufficient to guide him to the Father, that explication is his addition; nay the light that all men have, though it ſeem to make them know God <hi>as God,</hi> yet it ſufficeth not to make them know that there is a <hi>Father,</hi> that is, to informe them that there is Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son and Holy Ghoſt, or that there is any Goſpel: Since natural light inſiſts only on the moral Law and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works; for there cannot be more written in the heart of fallen man without further revelation than there w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But let all Chriſtians marke the poiſon that lyes under theſe lips; every man hath a light, that is, a light within him; (for ſo they ſtill expreſſe it) to help him to life and guide him to the Father. Therefore 1. <hi>No need of teaching,</hi> or the miniſtry of man, that is his own inference here; therefore come no more at Sermons. 2. <hi>Nor need of Scripture:</hi> For

Therefore throw away Scripture as a dead letter. 3. <hi>Nor need of grace;</hi> for every man that comes into the world, whether he have grace or no grace, hath that light with him: which if he will make uſe of it, it is enough for him, therefore ſet up free-will, which Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers (as they conceive that are neerly acquainted with them) call <hi>a power accompanying the light to deſtroy every evil as appears in them that yields themſelves to it, and watch that their vain mindes draw them not from abiding in the the pure light of Chriſt:</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. That his inference is little worth, becauſe it is brought from a falſe ground of his own, to wit, that every man hath a light in him ſufficient to bring him to God, when none can come to God but by Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. Nor by Chriſt unleſſe by faith, nor have any ſuch faith or dinarily, unleſſe by hearing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. Nor hear without the Word of God, which every man hath not, yea, the Gentiles in general are ſaid <hi>not to have the Law</hi> Rom. 2.14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the thing it ſelf, when he ſaith, <hi>what need of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> I do thereupon demand of him (not to what purpoſe the Quakers teach, for ſure there is no need of their teaching, yet they that make nothing of other mens teaching, make ſomething, yea, much of their own; but I demand) what need had Chriſt to ſend forth his apoſtles, and bid them go and teach all Nations? <hi>Math</hi> 28.19. Or what need had Chriſt to give ſome to be Teachers to the end of the world? Is it not
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:183687:9"/>for <hi>the perfecting of the Saints till we all come to a perfect man?</hi> Eph. 4.11, 12, 13. Or what need had the author to the Hebrews to ſay both theſe things <hi>you ought to be Teachers and have need to be taught?</hi> Heb. 5.12. And yet ſure thoſe Hebrews had as much light in them as is in every man that comes into the world.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſidering there be ſome places of Scripture ſeeming to make the teaching of men not ſo needfull. I ſhall for ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of weaker Chriſtians ſpeak a little to thoſe Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>The Scriptures are <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.27. In regard of both which I ſhall ſpeak generally and particularly.</p>

Becauſe other Scriptures declare the teaching of men to be neceſſary <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies <hi>neceſſity is laid upon me</hi> 1 Cor. 9.16. Yea, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.2.<note n="w" place="margin">Jer. 3.15.</note> The Goſpel Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy (ſuch as that of <hi>Jeremy</hi> is) runs thus, <hi>we will go to the Mountain of the Lord and he will teach us,</hi> to wit, by the Law coming out of Sion, and the word from Jeruſalem, by the mouthes of Gods meſſengers, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.7, 8. Adde to this, that Chriſtians alſo are <hi>to teach and admoniſh one another,</hi> Col. 3.16.

                  <p n="2">2. It's true that the Hebrew, Greek, and Latine pronounes are tranſlated [thou] in our Engliſh tongue when a ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is ſpoken too. Nor is there any irreverence in ſpeaking ſo in our prayers to the great God, becauſe in our Engliſh tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Scripture, Scripture-prayers are ſo expreſſed, and the uſe of all the people of God in England hath ſo far obtain'd, that there is no abatement of the honour of God in it. But on the other ſide, ſuch is and hath been the conſtant manner of ſpeaking in this Nation, that it is thereby become offenſive to ſay <hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee</hi> to our ſuperiours, and when ſuch offence, may be avoided by another way of ſpeaking which (according to the uſage of our Engliſh Tougue)<note place="margin">Loquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum ut vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus.</note> is as proper as that, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence ought to be avoided; for Scripture ſaith, <hi>Give no offence,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.32. To wit, if it may lawfull, fairely, and eſpecially <hi>eaſily,</hi> be prevented, the old rules is to ſpeak as people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly and ordinarily ſpeake. Now cuſtome hath made it to be the civility of our language to teſtifie our reſpect by ſaying <hi>you,</hi> and diſreſpect by ſaying <hi>thou,</hi> to any ſuperiour or equal (unleſſe it be in a way of familiarity)</p>
